Here, we provide an implementation of the network described in our work

"Deep Supervised Dictionary Learning by Algorithm Unrolling - Application to Fast 2D Dynamic MR Image Reconstruction"

by A. Kofler, M.C. Pali, T. Schaeffter and C. Kolbitsch.

The method is a so-called physics-informed neural network that implements an algorithm that approaches the solution of the problem

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\underset{\mathbf{x},&space;\\{\boldsymbol{\gamma}_j\\}_j}{\mathrm{min}}&space;\frac{1}{2}\|\|&space;\mathbf{F}_I\mathbf{x}&space;&space;&space;-\mathbf{y}_I\|\|_2^2&space;&plus;&space;\frac{\lambda}{2}&space;\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\mathbf{d},\mathbf{s}}}&space;\|\|&space;\mathbf{R}_j^{\mathbf{d},&space;\mathbf{s}}&space;\mathbf{x}&space;-&space;\mathbf{\Psi}&space;\boldsymbol{\gamma}_j&space;\|\|_2^2&space;&plus;&space;\beta&space;\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\mathbf{d},\mathbf{s}}}&space;\|\|&space;\boldsymbol{\gamma}_j\|\|_1)

by alternating minimization. The weights of the network - i.e. the atoms of the dictionary and the regularization parameters ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\lambda) and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\beta) - can be trained in a supervised and physics-informed way.

## Code

By running the files dlmri_reco_example.py and dlmri_denoising_example.py you can get familiar with how to apply the networks to an undersampled MRI reconstruction problem and a image denoising problem.

## Results

The main results of the paper are the following:

First, we have observed that reconstructing images with the dictionary obtained by training it via algorithm unrolling yields superior results compared to the dictionary obtained by decoupled pre-training, i.e. using the LASSO algorithm to solve a sparse approximation problem to obtain the dictionary.

Second, we have introduced a 2D spatio-temporal dictionary that yields superior results compared to the standard choice of the 3D dictionary.

The following shows a comparison of an image obtained using the 3D dictionary pre-trained by employing the LASSO algorithm and an image obtained with the proposed 2D spatio-temporal dictionary that was trained usin by algorithm unrolling, both results are shown for a dictionary of shape ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?d\times&space;K) with ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?K=d=64).
