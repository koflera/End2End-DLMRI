This folder contains different dictionaries that can be used to approximate patches of shape [dx, dy, dt]. Each dictionary is a matrix of shape d x K,
where d = dx * dy * dt and d<K<4d. More precisely, we have three different types of dictionaries with three different overcompleteness factors, i.e.
K=d, K=2d and K=4d. The substring "lasso" in the filename refers to dictionaries that have been pre-trained using the LASSO algorithm, see
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_image_denoising.html#learn-the-dictionary-from-reference-patches

The substring "nn" refers to dictionaries that have been trained by backpropagation as described in our paper for this work, i.e. by unrolling the 
corresponding reconstruction algorithm assuming the dictionary to be fixed and using input-target image pairs.
